# ML Lab

Explore Core ML models in action.

This app is a collection of machine learning models. It was developed as part of a seminar talk on **»Training and implementing an image classifier using Create ML and Core ML«** for **iOS Application Development** at RWTH Aachen (Prof. Jan Borchers).

We implemented two models from the [Apple Developer Website]() 

Available models:
- Image Classifier
    - SqueezeNet
    - Cats and Dogs (trained by us)
- Object Detector
    - YOLO Tiny Int8 LUT

## Tutorial

We have built a step-by-step tutorial to implement an image classifier using Core ML.
You can find it [here](https://lambdadigamma.github.io/ML-Playground/tutorials/tutorial-table-of-contents).
